  "explanation": "**Optimal Solution: Counter or Dictionary - O(n)**\n\n**Example:** arr = [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n\n**Approach 1: Counter (Pythonic)**\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\ncount = Counter(arr)\n# Counter({3: 4, 1: 2, 2: 2})\n\nmost_common = count.most_common(1)\n# [(3, 4)]\n\nresult = most_common[0][0]  # 3\n```\n\n**Approach 2: Manual Dictionary**\n```python\nfreq = {}\nfor num in arr:\n    freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1\n\nmax_count = max(freq.values())\nresult = [k for k, v in freq.items() if v == max_count][0]\n```\n\n**Visual Counting Process:**\n```\nArray: [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n        ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓\nCount:  1  1  1  2  2  3  2  4\n       {1} {3} {2}     ↑      ↑\n                    (3 appears 4 times - winner!)\n```\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Method 1: Counter (recommended)\ndef mostCommon1(arr):\n    return Counter(arr).most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n# Method 2: Dictionary\ndef mostCommon2(arr):\n    freq = {}\n    max_count = 0\n    result = None\n    for num in arr:\n        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1\n        if freq[num] > max_count:\n            max_count = freq[num]\n            result = num\n    return result\n```\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Time: O(n) - single pass through array\n- Space: O(k) where k = unique elements\n\n**Key Insight:** Counter is built on dictionary but provides cleaner API for counting tasks.",
